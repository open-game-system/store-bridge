# @open-game-system/store-bridge Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the store-bridge library which provides a universal bridge that connects web games and the OpenGame App through a shared state store.

## Directory Structure

- `client/`: Web client implementations
- `native/`: React Native and host platform implementations
- `react/`: React integration with context providers and hooks
- `testing/`: Testing utilities for mocking bridges and stores
- `types/`: Core TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Shared utility functions

## Implementation Details

This is an early version of the project with placeholder implementations. Most of the functions will throw "not implemented" errors until they are properly implemented.

The TypeScript typings are complete and can be used as a reference for the expected behavior of each component.

## Development Status

The codebase follows the structure outlined in the README.md and PLAN.md documents:

1. All type definitions are complete
2. React integration patterns are established
3. Core interfaces are well-defined
4. The package exports are set up according to specification

Next steps:

1. Implement the actual functionality for each placeholder function
2. Set up automated tests
3. Expand documentation with detailed API references
